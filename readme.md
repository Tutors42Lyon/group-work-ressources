## Branching, merging and pull requests

How to isolate work, collaborate safely, and review code changes.

### Why do we even need branches ?

- [An explanation here [EN]](https://blog.while-true-do.io/git-next-steps/)
- [Use good branches names](https://conventional-branch.github.io/)

### Why are pull requests and code reviews useful ? 

- [Code quality](https://railsware.com/blog/pull-request-review-from-a-railsware-engineers-perspective/)

## Useful VSCode extensions

Tools to streamline collaboration, code reviews, and task tracking directly in the editor.

- Pull requests from VSCode: [GitHub Pull Request](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github)
- Turn your comments into a todo list [ToDo Tree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree)
- Collaborative coding: [Microsoft Liveshare](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vsliveshare.vsliveshare)

## Issues

Track tasks, bugs, and features systematically.

### Issues driven developpement (IDD)

Organize work around tracked tasks for clarity and accountability.
